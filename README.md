## üßÅ Day 8 - Cupcake Function Practice

Today I learned how to:
- Create and call functions in Python
- Use `if` and `else` conditions
- Understand indentation (how to organize code blocks)
- Build a fun function that prints cupcake messages based on size, flavor, and sprinkles

### üß™ Example Code:
```python
def make_cupcake(size, flavor, sprinkles):
    message = "Here is your " + size + " " + flavor + " cupcake!"
    if sprinkles == "yes":
        message += " Sprinkles included!"
    print(message)

make_cupcake("small", "chocolate", "yes")
